Documentation. 

Overview:
For my QAP1 I choose the Simple Banking Application 
This Application supports Account Creation including a account number and initial deposit, 
- also supports regular deposits and withdraws. I added 3 test cases to ensure the app being run properly.


Features: 
A class for creating a bank account 
A class to set up deposits and withdraws. 
A class to display account details such as the Account Number, Initial Balnce, Amount Deopsited and Withdrawn, 
and the Current balance after all actions preformed. 
 
Testing Files:
1. testAccountCreation(); Testing Account Creation - getAccountNumber & getBalance after creating account.
2. testDuplicateAccount(); Testing Duplicate Accounts 
3. testWithdrawn(); Testing Withdrawal Amount - Testing to produce the right balance after withdraw.

Clean Code Practices:
1. At the top of each file there is a commented section expalaining what the file does.

2. Provided Meaningfull Names, Every varable is named to what it corresponds to.

3. There are multiple files to seperate the code, making it easier to under stand what is going on within the application.
