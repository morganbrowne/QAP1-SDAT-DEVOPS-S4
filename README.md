Documentation. 

Overview:
For my QAP1 I choose the Simple Banking Application. 
This Application supports Account Creation including a account number and initial deposit, 
- also supports regular deposits and withdraws. I added 3 test cases to ensure the app being run properly.


Features: 
A class for creating a bank account 
A class to set up deposits and withdraws. 
A class to display account details such as the Account Number, Initial Balnce, Amount Deopsited and Withdrawn, 
and the Current balance after all actions preformed. 
 
Testing Files:
1. testAccountCreation(); Testing Account Creation - getAccountNumber & getBalance after creating account.
2. testDuplicateAccount(); Testing Duplicate Accounts 
3. testWithdrawn(); Testing Withdrawal Amount - Testing to produce the right balance after withdraw.

Clean Code Practices:
1. At the top of each file there is a commented section expalaining what the file does.
